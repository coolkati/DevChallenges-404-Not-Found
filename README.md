## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/coolkati/DevChallenges-404-Not-Found/blob/main/desktopsc.PNG)

This project is a recreation of the design found on <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/QeKWLNhB13zDjJzqR22TKE/404-page-challenge?node-id=0%3A1">figma</a>. Some of the major things I accomplished doing this were: learning how to better plan creation of a design, learning a new methodology for class naming, and refreshing my pure CSS skills, since I didn't use a framework. Additionally, I set up hosting of a site on Firebase for the first time, which was useful to learn. 

### Built With
